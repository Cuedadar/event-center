# Event Center - Orpheum Theatre Memphis Website

This project demonstrates my ability to structure content, style elements, and implement responsive design.

**A live version of the site can be found at *[Netlify](https://jtking-orpheum.netlify.app/)***

The website uses HTML and CSS to create an example site for the Orpheum Theatre of Memphis. It includes

- Home
- Events
- Menu
- Location
- Contact Us

The index.html is your starting point into the website. All other files are grouped into the corresponding folders: css, html, and image assets.

A sticky navigation bar is at the top of every page and the site is entirely responsive across multiple screen sizes through the use of media queries

If I were to re-visit this project I might add more interactivity in the form of hovers. There are no examples of animations or grid layout. I would also use Javascript to increase the reusability of the navigation bar across multiple html pages.

All images come from their current live site found at [Orpheum Memphis](https://www.orpheum-memphis.com/)
